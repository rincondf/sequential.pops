## Introduction

The `sequential.pops` package is designed to simplify the development, evaluation 
and implementation of sequential designs for testing hypotheses about population
density. Sequential analyses are particularly useful for decision-making in situations 
where estimation is not the goal, but critical actions should be triggered when
population sizes reach or are above or below predefined levels. This situations include
pest mana


```{r setup}
library(sequential.pops)
```
