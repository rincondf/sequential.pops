# sequential.pops: Sequential analysis of biological populations sizes
Tools to test sequnetially hypotheses about population sizes. Two approaches are included.
1. The sequential test of Bayesian psterior probabilities (Rincon, D.F., McCabe, I. & Crowder, D.W. 2025): This test is based on a sequence of conditional probabilities obtained from the data and can can explicitly consider simple or composite hypotheses about static or dynamic population densities and process either purely sequential (one-at-a-time) or group sequential data.
2. The sequential probability ratio test (Wald, A. 1945): This test is based on probability ratios obtained from the likelihood of the data fro two contrasted (non-complementary) hypotheses.

This package includes tools to run the tests, produce charts with stop lines, and summarize results.
